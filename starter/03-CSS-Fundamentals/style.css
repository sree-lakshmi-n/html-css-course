Suppose we only want the paragraphs that are inside of headers,

This works and is called nested descendent selector

But we are now even more encoding the HTML structure into our CSS selectors, and that can make our code hard to maintain in the future if we ever change our HTML.
And so that's not a good idea.
So, we use class and id selectors.

Nothing happens. No paragraph turned red.
The misconception is that this selector here should have selected the first p element inside of the article.

The paragraph, 'Posted by Laura Jones on Monday, June 21st 2027' is in fact the first paragraph inside of the article however, not the first child of the article.
The first child of article is actually header. So this would only work if a paragraph, would actually be to first element of the article.

What this means is that the margin on the left needs to
be the same than the margin on the right side.
And they should both be calculated automatically

And so therefore this will mean that there will be a margin
on the left and on the right, which will be exactly the same size.
And therefore, as a result, the container will look centered inside of the body.

/* Types of Boxes */
/*
Inline boxes - Those which occupy only the amount of space needed for its content. Eg. a, img, strong, em, button
Don't create any line breaks before/ after the element.
Heights and widths don't apply.
Paddings and margins are applied only horizontally (left and right).

display:inline;

Block level boxes - Occupy all the space they can. Create line breaks after them. Eg. h1, p, div, body, main, header, 
They are formatted visually as blocks.
Occupy 100% of the parent width, no matter the content. Elements are stacked vertically by default, one after another.

display:block;

inline-block
Looks like inline from the outside, behaves like block-level on the inside.
Occupies only the content's space.
Causes no line breaks
